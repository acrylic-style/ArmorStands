# ArmorStands

## How to use
0. requires 1.16.5 spigot/paper server
1. Put frames with .bmp to `plugins/ArmorStands/frames/`
2. `/aload` - it loads all frames that directory
3. `/aspawn` - it spawns all required armor stands. never got it to work. client freezes before all required armor stands renders.
4. `/astart <fps>` - starts animation with specified fps (untested)
5. `/astop` - not implemented

if you were able to run with 480x360, please let me know. (requires 172,800 armor stands for that)
